# README.md

This is a sample README file. It will show up on the github homepage for the project.

You can format it with markdown.

You should describe the project at a high level.

## Data

There is a data directory in this repository. You NEVER COMMIT DATA to github (generally). You can add this directory to the .gitignore and it should ignore it. It is only committed here to show you that it exists locally.

## requirements.txt

The requirements file specifies the packages that are required to run your code. You can use it to configure a new conda environment by running `pip install requirements.txt`

## Using git

Git is an incredibly useful tool for collaborating with others and keeping your own work organized. There are in-depth and interactive courses for git available online if you would like more information, but as a short introduction take a look at [this guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/).
