This is a sample README file. It will show up on the github homepage for the project.

You can format it with markdown (I don't usually).

You should describe the project at a high level.

There is a data directory in this repository. You NEVER COMMIT DATA to github (generally). You can add this directory to the .gitignore and it should ignore it. It is only committed here to show you that it exists locally.
